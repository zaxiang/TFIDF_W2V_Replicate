The data is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JnEphgsneXqbo71g3-xCgL9jSeA5lOO_?usp=share_link)


## Results:

Models' F1_Score Compared with Results in the Paper:
![alt text](images/Week5_S_checkpoint/scores.png)

the accuracy scores are highlighted in yellow

Difference with the Given Results:
![alt text](images/Week5_S_checkpoint/difference.png)

with TFIDF: I have slighter better results than the given F1 scores for two datasets, the rest are only slighter lower than the given performance (with no more than 0.1 difference)/

with Word2Vec, I have slighter better results than the given F1 scores for three coarse datasets, yet the performance for the fine nyt dataset are a lot lower than the given performance.
